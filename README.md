# Guava-Leaf-Disease-Detection
Detecting different kind's of diseases that would appear on a Guava Leaf.
Alongside constructing a custom built Convolutional Auto Encoder Neural Network, a pre-trained model has been used as well which is the EfficientNet-b0.

The functional scripts were written in python files while the interractial files for both models were in Jupyter Notebook.

Accuracies of:

- 97.7% for the custom built CNN-AE 
- 99.4% for the EfficientNet-b0
